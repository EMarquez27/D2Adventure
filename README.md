A simple adventure game by Elyzza Joyce Marquez based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Doorway, Sink, WalkWay, Stairs, BadEnd, GoodEnd.

- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Intro, Outro1, Outro2

- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).
    - Enhancement 2: unsatisfied (name the method and explain the use of it).

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Doorway, WalkWay, Sink, Stairs 

- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Coat, Painting, PepperSpray, Keys

- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: All interactable objects have a pointerover to describe it. For example, the painting in the doorway have a pointerover only to describe it. the mirror in the bathroom has a pointerover.

- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Collectable objects have a pointer down. (Ex. pepperspray, keys, coat)

- **Some objects are themselves animated**: unsatisfied (describe two examples)

Asset sources:
- (For each image/audio/video asset used, describe how it was created. What tool did you use to create it? Was it based on another work? If so, how did you change it, and where can we learn more about the original work for comparison? Use [Markdown link syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#links).)

All assets were hand drawn by me in procreate. The only asset not from me is the right arrow in the walkway scene. This is from an emoji application from VSCODE(emojisense by Matt Bierner).

Code sources:
- `adventure.js` and `index.html` were created for this project [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and edited by me.
- `game.js` was sketched by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly) and rewritten by me.
